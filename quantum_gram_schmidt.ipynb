    "- Quantum Gram-Schmidt algorithm is closely related to Classical Gram-Schmidt process but does something entirely different. QGS is used to generate a **complete row basis** by performing a quantum version of *adapting sampling* on the rows.\n",
    "    - rows which have a larger orthogonal part to the previously sampled row submatrix, will be sampled with a larger probability.\n",
    "    - This ensures that the complete basis is non-singular."
