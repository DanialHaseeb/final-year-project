# Lesson Plan Draft

## Linear Algebra Review

- What is complete basis?
- What is row basis?
- What is complete row basis?
- Recall: Relation between linear independence and complete basis

## Gram-Schmidt Process

- What is the Gram-Schmidt process?
- Application of Gram-Schmidt process to quantum states (in ML and other areas)

### Easy example: State discrimination

- State discrimination problem
- Application in query complexity
- Problem when applying Gram-Schimidt process to quantum states (exponential blowup)

## What is the quantum Gram-Schmidt process?

- High-level overview of the quantum Gram-Schmidt process
- The math
  - exercises (?)
- The circuit
  - exercises (?)
- Solved example: Quantum Gram-Schmidt process

### Application 1: Back to State discrimination

### Application 2: Quantum Gram-Schmidt process for quantum states
